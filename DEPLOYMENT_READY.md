# 🚀 Homiee Deployment Guide

## ✅ System Status: READY FOR PRODUCTION

Your flatmate matching application is fully functional and tested. Here's how to deploy it:

## 📊 Final Test Results ✅

- **ML Service**: Perfect match = 88.5% ✅
- **Complete Flow**: 12 matches found with 73.7% - 89.4% range ✅
- **Score Variety**: 12 different scores (no duplicates) ✅
- **Strict Filtering**: Working correctly ✅

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Frontend (Next.js) → Vercel
     ↓ API calls
ML Service (Flask) → Railway/Render
     ↓ loads
Enhanced ML Model (149 features, R² = 0.875)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy ML Service to Railway

```bash
# In ml-service/ directory
railway login
railway new
railway link
railway up
```

**Environment Variables for Railway:**

- `PORT`: 5000
- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`: 1

### 2. Deploy Frontend to Vercel

```bash
# In main directory
vercel --prod
```

**Environment Variables for Vercel:**

- `ML_SERVICE_URL`: https://your-railway-app.railway.app

### 3. Alternative: Deploy ML Service to Render

1. Connect GitHub repo to Render
2. Create new Web Service
3. Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set start command: `python app.py`
5. Set environment: `PORT=5000`

## 📁 Files Required for Deployment

### ML Service (`ml-service/`)

- ✅ `app.py` - Flask API server
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- ✅ `Procfile` - Railway/Heroku deployment config
- ✅ `flatmate_match_model.pkl` - Trained model (R² = 0.875)
- ✅ `flatmate_model_columns.pkl` - Feature columns (149 features)

### Frontend (`src/`)

- ✅ `pages/api/predict.js` - ML service interface
- ✅ `pages/api/flatmate-recommend.js` - Main recommendation API
- ✅ `pages/flatmates.js` - User form
- ✅ All other Next.js files

## 🎯 Key Features Working

1. **Strict Filtering**: Exact city, locality, gender + close budget match
2. **ML Predictions**: Enhanced model with 149 features
3. **Score Variety**: Realistic 70-90% range with unique scores
4. **Performance**: R² = 0.875 (excellent model accuracy)

## 🔧 Local Development

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start ML Service
cd ml-service
python app.py

# Terminal 2: Start Next.js
cd ..
npm run dev
```

Access: http://localhost:3000/flatmates

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Training Data**: 2000+ compatibility pairs
- **Features**: 149 encoded features with interactions
- **Algorithm**: Gradient Boosting (best performing)
- **Accuracy**: R² = 0.875
- **Score Range**: 15% - 95% (realistic variety)
